# Assessing the importance of considering long transient dynamics in management actions

This repo contains all of the code and description for the model used in the simulation study that will (?) demonstrate the importance of considering long transient dynamics in evaluating potential managemen interventions. If a system appears to be in a steady state (either an equilibrium or regular oscillations) managers may consider this to be the asymptotic behaviour of the system. However many ecological systems exhibit extremely long periods of transient dynamics that are indistinguishable from asymptotic dynamics. At some point in the future, the transient period will end, changing the state of the system drastically. Here, we use a stage-structured population model prone to long periods of transient oscllations to illustrate the consequences of competing management strategies.

## Population model


We use python to numerically solve this population model in transient_pop.py
