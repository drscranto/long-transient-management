# Assessing the importance of considering long transient dynamics in management actions

This repo contains all of the code and description for the case studies used in the paper.

## Linear stage structured populations - conservation (?)

The long transient is the excursion away from the stable stage distribution.

## Nonlinear single population - disease outbreaks

The long transient is induced by the saddle at N*=0.

## Nonlinear competition between two species - invasive species

The long transient is due to the saddle at (N*,0).

## Nonlinear ecosystem model - eutrophic/oligotrophic lakes

The long transient is caused by slow movement away from the ghost of the attractor lost due to nutrient loading.

## Nonlinear ecosystem model - fish habitat

The long transient is caused by the different timescales of the fish population dynamics (fast) and the production of new fallen tree habitat (slow).

## Nonlinear stage structured populations

The long transient is caused by the high (infinite) dimensionality of the system introduced by the delay term.

We use python to numerically solve this population model in transient_pop.py
